# RSA Algorithm

The reading project was on public key encryption using “The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) Algorithm for Public-Key Cryptography”. The aim of the project was to read the material provided and understand the mathematics of the algorithm within the stipulated short time and present the understanding to the professor.

The definitions of public key, private key, confidentiality, authentication and confidentiality-authentication were learnt. Following this, the mathematics of the RSA Algorithm was covered. This algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt messages to prevent attack from hackers. It is based on the fact that there is no standard algorithm which can factorise a very large number. If this number is a product of two equally sized prime numbers, then some special properties of its totient can be used.

It primarily involves the definition and properties of totient of an integer. Euler’s theorem plays a major role in this. Modulo arithmetic is the backbone. Public and private keys are just numbers. The next step is to prove the RSA Algorithm. The numbers involved in this algorithm have to satisfy other criteria in order to prevent attack from hackers. Hence, there are certain computational steps to be followed during key generation for the primes, public exponent and private exponent. A toy example was taken up and explained in order to understand how the values for the primes, public exponent and private exponent must be assigned. These values are set in binary representation.
There are certain cases under which the security of the system is unstable. These cases are called as “Vulnerabilities of the RSA Algorithm”. There are four kinds – vulnerabilities caused by lack of forward secrecy, chosen cipher attacks, vulnerabilities caused by low-entropy random numbers and mathematical attack. There are various methods to resolve the same. The security of this algorithm is critically dependant on the difficulty of factorising very large numbers.

# Convolutional Coding 

The reading project was on Convolutional Coding. The aim of the project was to read the material provided and understand the mathematics of the algorithm within the stipulated short time and present the understanding to the professor. 

The algorithm of Convolutional Coding was learnt. Followed by that, the decoding of the algorithm using Viterbi's trellis structure were covered. The definition of rate of code were understood. A deeper insight into the different Error Correcting Codes used in different cellular technologies were studied. For instance, 3G architecture used Convolutional codes whereas 4G technology uses Reed Solomon Codes and Turbo Codes. The popular error correction codes for 5G are LDPC and Polar Codes. 

In the process, a brief understanding of GSM architecture, differences between 3G, 4G and 5G in terms of architecture and definitions were studied. The power and memory requirements of error correction codes based on the application/technology were also discussed during the interactions with the professor.
